This project is a fullstack test project for devit company.

Although it is a test project, I implemented many features that I have learned in the past few years.

## Features
- [x] JWT Authentication
- [x] GraphQL
- [x] Typeorm
- [x] Task Scheduling
- [x] next-auth
- [x] NX Workspace
- [x] Caching
- [x] Debounced search

## How to run
- Clone the project
- Run `npm install` in the root directory
- Run `docker-compose up -d` in the root directory
- Run `npm run start-app` in the root directory or simply `make`

## How to run tests
Currently, test files are created in the same directory as the source files, but those tests are dummy tests. I will add more tests in the future.

## Epilogue

I really loved to use all modern technologies I used for the first time, and been glad to remember learned time ago. I have learned a lot from this project, and I am sure that I will use all of them in the future.

Special thanks to @AnnaValman for giving me this opportunity.
